# Spec 04 — Ribbon UI Refinement: Audit Report

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | Audit complete; triaged → **M1 (framework + rename) + M2 (labeled-group standardization) implemented**. M4 → M3 → M5/M6 next (triaged sequence). Q2 features (cut/copy/paste + find/replace) are real editor features with no existing backing — building them with their backing is the next focused step (no dead buttons). |
| **Method** | Audit-first per Spec 04 §4: inventory the ribbon, run the render-capability audit (§10 — the committed capability table), and confirm the Blitz layout surface for the collapse engine. |
| **Companion** | [spec-04-ribbon-ui-refinement.md](spec-04-ribbon-ui-refinement.md) (the design spec) |
| **Precedent** | Same audit-then-triage flow as [spec-01](spec-01-audit-report.md) / [spec-02](spec-02-conformance-inventory.md) / [spec-03](spec-03-responsive-audit.md). |

This report establishes ground truth and a finding register (RB-1 … RB-12). It makes
**no code changes** — implementation waits for triage. The §4 **capability table**
is the headline deliverable.

---

## 1. Executive summary

- **The framework is more built than the spec assumed — the work is mostly *content*, not new framework.** The contextual-tab mechanism already exists (`RibbonTabDesc.is_contextual`, amber styling) but is unused; labeled groups already exist (`AtRibbonGroup.label: Option<String>`) — the Write/Home tab simply passes `None` (icon-only) while Publish passes `Some` (labeled). So **D1 (rename), D2 (labeled everywhere), and the contextual mechanism are largely a matter of using what's there** (RB-1).
- **What's genuinely missing is the collapse engine.** Today the ribbon has only a collapse *toggle* (hide the whole content row) + `overflow-x: auto` scroll — no width-driven full→condensed→overflow cascade (RB-2). This is the real M3 build.
- **The capability table (§4) is decisive:** 5 objects **Create-ready** (images, tables, headers/footers, hyperlinks, **footnotes**), 1 **Render-only** (math), 1 **Unsupported** (shapes). Notably the audit **upgrades footnotes** from the spec's seed ("renders to an extent") to *complete render* → Create-ready (RB-7), and **confirms math render-only / shapes unsupported** with code evidence (RB-8/RB-9).
- **Blitz surface is sufficient:** a component can measure its **own** width via `onmounted`→`get_client_rect().await`, `use_viewport().inner_width_px` gives the px the width-driven engine needs, the overflow menu can use `position: absolute` (spell-panel precedent), and the `resolve_page_fit` hysteresis pattern (`PAGE_FIT_HYSTERESIS_PX = 48`) is the template for collapse hysteresis (RB-10).
- **One spec correction:** the "existing bottom-ribbon-for-touch placement" **does not exist** — only safe-area-inset + Compact-detection infrastructure for it. M6 frames it "where applicable," so it stays optional (RB-11).

**Readiness:** M1 (rename + framework polish), M2 (labeled groups), and M4 (Insert from the table) are low-risk and mostly content. M3 (collapse engine) is the substantive new build. **No code changed.**

## 2. Ribbon framework inventory (`appthere-ui/src/components/ribbon/`)

| Component | File | Renders | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `AtRibbon` | `mod.rs:84` | tab strip + content row shell | props: `tabs`, `active_tab`, `on_tab_select`, `collapsed`, `on_toggle_collapse`, `tab_content` |
| `AtRibbonTabStrip` | `tab_strip.rs:31` | tab-label row + collapse button | height **36 px** (`RIBBON_TAB_STRIP_HEIGHT`, `tokens/layout.rs:65`) — **R-14** |
| `AtRibbonContent` | `content_row.rs:26` | scrollable group row | `overflow-x: auto` (the only overflow today) |
| `AtRibbonGroup` | `group.rs:28` | labeled section | `label: Option<String>` — **labeled groups already supported** |
| `AtRibbonIconButton` | `button.rs:38` | 44×44 button | icon child *or* text-span child (labeled) — both styles already possible |
| `AtRibbonSelect` | `select.rs:52` | style-picker dropdown | hardcoded `width: 180px` (`select.rs:73`) — **R-13e** |
| `RibbonTabDesc` | `mod.rs:57` | `{ label, is_contextual, aria_label }` | **contextual mechanism already present** (`is_contextual`) |

**Framework capabilities — present vs. missing:**

| Capability | Status |
|---|---|
| Contextual-tab mechanism (`is_contextual`, amber styling) | ✅ present, **unused** by the app (no selection signal feeds it — RB-5) |
| Labeled groups (`label: Some(..)`) | ✅ present, used only by Publish |
| Labeled *buttons* (text span in `AtRibbonIconButton`, `label_node`) | ✅ present (Publish) |
| Collapse **toggle** (hide content row) + horizontal scroll | ✅ present |
| **Width-driven collapse cascade** (full→condensed→overflow) | ❌ **missing** — the M3 build (RB-2) |
| **Overflow "more" menu** | ❌ missing |
| Per-group **collapse priority** + condensed/overflow representations | ❌ missing |

---

## 3. Tab / group / control inventory

| Tab | Idx | Style | Groups → controls |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Home** (→ Write) | 0 | **icon-only** (`label: None` everywhere) | Document (Save / Save As / Save as Template), History (Undo / Redo), Styles (`AtRibbonSelect` para style — the Spec 05 entry point), Paragraph (edit-style), Inline (Bold / Italic / Underline / Strike / Super / Sub) |
| **Publish** | 1 | **labeled groups** (the target standard) | Export (PDF/X, EPUB — labeled buttons), Metadata (Edit metadata — labeled) |

Tabs are composed in `editor_inner.rs` (the `AtRibbon { tabs: vec![…], tab_content: match … }`); Home content in `editor_ribbon.rs`, Publish in `editor_publish.rs`. i18n keys in `ribbon.ftl` / `publish.ftl`.

**Mapping to the Spec 04 tab set (§9):** Write's existing groups (Document/History/Styles/Paragraph/Inline) map cleanly onto the proposed **Write** (Clipboard/Font/Paragraph/Styles/Editing); the existing controls are a subset — the spec's instruction "map, don't invent" holds. **Insert / Layout / References / Review** are net-new tabs whose *contents* are gated by §4 (Insert) and the existing model/render features (Layout/References/Review map to already-supported page geometry, footnotes, spelling, comments).

---

## 4. The render-capability table (committed deliverable — Spec 04 §10)

For each insertable object: **Import** (mapper parses it), **Render** (layout + paint, evidenced by code + an ACID `TC-*` case + `fidelity-status.md`), **Create** (a model-construction path).

| Object (model type) | Import | Render | Create | **Verdict** | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Image** (`Inline::Image`) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ cheap | **Create-ready** | import `docx/mapper/images.rs`; paint `loki-vello/src/image.rs:29` `paint_image`; ACID TC-DOCX-023/024. Create = construct `Inline::Image` + existing `loki-file-access` picker. |
| **Table** (`Block::Table`) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ cheap | **Create-ready** | import `docx/mapper/table.rs:25`; layout `loki-layout/src/flow.rs:1527` `flow_table`; ACID TC-DOCX-003…007. Create = build an n×m `Table`. |
| **Header / Footer** (`PageLayout`) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ moderate | **Create-ready** | layout `flow.rs:960` `assign_headers_footers` (per-page, PAGE/NUMPAGES live); ACID TC-DOCX-018 / TC-ODT-008; `fidelity-status.md` §1. Create = insert a `HeaderFooter { blocks }` into `PageLayout` (needs a small edit surface, not geometry). |
| **Hyperlink** (`Inline::Link`) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ cheap | **Create-ready** | import `docx/mapper/inline.rs:85`; renders as styled inline text; ACID TC-DOCX-022. Create = wrap selection in `Inline::Link(target)`; URL via text entry. |
| **Footnote / Endnote** (`Inline::Note`) | ✅ | ✅ **complete** | ✅ cheap | **Create-ready** ⬆ | import `docx/mapper/inline.rs:260/267`; layout `flow.rs:1126` `flow_footnotes` (numbering, per-section restart, separator); ACID TC-DOCX-020 / TC-ODT-009; `fidelity-status.md` §1 row 16. **Audit upgrades the spec's "renders to an extent" → complete render.** Create = insert `Inline::Note(kind, blocks)`; auto-numbers. |
| **Math** (`Inline::Math` / MathML) | ✅ | ✅ **partial** | ❌ needs input surface | **Render-only** | import `docx/mapper/inline.rs:141` (OMML→MathML); layout `loki-layout/src/math/` (`mod.rs`/`compose.rs`/`shape.rs` — fractions, scripts, radicals, fences); ACID TC-DOCX-026. **Known first-pass gaps** (matrices, n-ary, accents, full mathspacing — `fidelity-status.md` §1 row 24). **No create path** — authoring needs an equation-input surface → a **future spec**, not this Insert tab. |
| **Shape** (DrawingML preset/freeform) | ❌ | ❌ | — | **Unsupported** | **No shape-geometry rendering anywhere** in `loki-layout`/`loki-vello` (the `math/shape.rs` is math-delimiter stretching, not DrawingML). DOCX drawings only reach the model as `Inline::Image` anchors. Shape support is a **future renderer spec** before any Insert control. |

**Tally:** **5 Create-ready** · **1 Render-only** (math) · **1 Unsupported** (shapes).

This satisfies M4's acceptance shape: every Insert control maps to a Create-ready row; math and shapes get **no control** (no dead UI); imported docs containing math/shapes still display (math renders; DOCX shapes fall back to image anchors).

---

## 5. Existing create/insert paths (for M4 reuse)

No new model-construction is needed for the Create-ready set — the constructors + Loro mutation layer suffice:

- **Image:** `Inline::Image` + `loki_file_access` picker (already used app-wide). No insert UI yet.
- **Table:** build a `Table` from grid geometry. No insert UI yet.
- **Header/Footer:** `PageLayout.header/footer` hold `Vec<Block>`; mutate via the Loro layer. Needs a small block-editor surface (the style-editor panel is a reusable pattern).
- **Hyperlink:** `Inline::Link(target, display)` over the selection.
- **Footnote/Endnote:** `Inline::Note(kind, blocks)` at the cursor; auto-numbered by `flow_footnotes`.
- Mutation layers: `loki-doc-model/src/loro_mutation/{text,block,style}.rs`.

### 5a. Live-model gap & the Loro-bridge extension (M4 prerequisite)

The §4 capability table rates render/construct readiness, but M4 scoping surfaced
a deeper constraint: the **live Loro CRDT** flattens or *opaquely* snapshots most
structured inlines (`Inline::Image`/`Note`/`Field`) and blocks (`Table`,
footnote bodies). An opaque block round-trips losslessly and renders, but is
**not live-editable** — so an Insert control over it would produce a non-editable
object, which Spec 04 forbids (no dead/inert UI). Only **Hyperlink**
(a `MARK_LINK_URL` text mark) was genuinely create-ready in the live model.

Per maintainer direction (*"do the Loro-bridge extension first"*), structured
inlines are being migrated to native CRDT mappings before the Insert tab ships,
one tested increment per turn:

The shared mechanism is `inlines::write_inline_object`: a top-level structured
inline is written as an `OBJECT_REPLACEMENT_CHAR` (U+FFFC) anchor carrying the
object as a `serde`-JSON mark (registered `ExpandType::None`), decoded back on
read by `inlines_read::decode_inline_object`; `opaque.rs` un-gates the variant
at top level only. An object *nested* inside a wrapper/run is still flattened by
the text path → its block stays opaque (no silent loss).

- **✅ Inline image (top-level)** — native via `MARK_IMAGE`. The image is a live,
  positioned, deletable inline; image-bearing paragraphs are no longer opaque.
  Tests: `loro_bridge_opaque_tests::{inline_image_stored_natively_not_opaque,
  nested_inline_image_stays_opaque_but_survives}`.
- **✅ Footnote / endnote (top-level)** — native via `MARK_NOTE`. The note
  *reference* is a discrete, deletable inline anchor; its `NoteKind` + block
  body round-trip losslessly in the mark (the body is a snapshot payload, not
  yet a live CRDT subtree). Tests: `footnote_stored_natively_not_opaque`,
  `endnote_kind_survives_native_roundtrip`, `nested_footnote_stays_opaque_but_survives`.
- **✅ Table (block-level)** — native `BLOCK_TYPE_TABLE` (`loro_bridge::table`).
  Stored as a **structural skeleton** (`KEY_TABLE_SKELETON`: the `Table` with
  cell blocks emptied — grid/col-specs, spans, cell & row props, borders,
  caption, attrs) plus **live per-cell block lists** (`KEY_TABLE_CELLS`: one
  CRDT container per cell, content via the shared block path). Cell *text* is
  therefore real CRDT state — concurrent edits to different cells merge — and
  the mapping recurses (a table nested in a cell is itself native). Structural
  edits (add row, change span) still rewrite the skeleton blob → not yet
  cell-structurally mergeable; full structural CRDT mapping is TODO. Tests:
  `loro_bridge_table_tests` (7 cases: native storage, separate cell containers,
  rich/empty cells, spans + props, nested table, positioning).

**Bridge-extension status: complete for the M4 Insert set.** Image, footnote,
hyperlink, and table all have live mappings; the Insert tab can now offer all
four without inert/dead UI. *(Caveat: the editor's `loro_mutation` API addresses
only top-level section blocks — creating/typing inside table cells and note
bodies needs a nested-addressing extension to that layer; tracked separately
from this bridge-representation work.)*

### 5b. M4 Insert tab — increment 1 (Hyperlink) shipped

The **Insert** ribbon tab now exists (Write · Insert · Publish), with its first
control: **Link**. Dependency analysis reorders the Insert set by *what is
useful today* without the deferred cell/note interior-editing work:

- **Hyperlink & Image** are fully useful now — they need no interior editing
  (the linked text already exists; an image displays on its own).
- **Table & Footnote** insert objects whose cells / bodies cannot yet be typed
  into (they await the `loro_mutation` nested-addressing extension), so adding
  their Insert controls now would create can't-fill objects — deferred.

Increment 1 ships **Hyperlink** end-to-end: `editor_insert::set_hyperlink`
(reuses `editor_formatting::resolve_format_range` + `mark_text`/`MARK_LINK_URL`)
applies/clears a link over the selection or word at the cursor; a small URL
panel (`editor_insert_panel`, docked above the ribbon like the metadata panel)
drives it. No dead buttons: the tab shows only the Link control. Tests:
`editor_insert` unit tests (selection, word-at-cursor, clear, trim). The Link
icon (`LUCIDE_LINK`) was added to `appthere_ui`.

Refactor folded in: the spelling, language, and link panels were bundled into
`editor_docked_panels::docked_panels` to keep `editor_inner` within its
baselined 878-line ceiling rather than growing it.

### 5c. M4 Insert tab — increment 2 (Image) shipped

The Insert tab now has a **Media → Image** control alongside Links → Link.

Key finding: the renderer decodes image bytes straight from a **`data:` URI** in
the image's URL (`loki-vello::image::decode_data_uri` → `image::load_from_memory`,
guessing the format from magic bytes) — there is **no separate media store**. So
runtime insertion is fully native with existing primitives:

- **Model**: new `loro_mutation::insert_inline_image` writes an
  `OBJECT_REPLACEMENT_CHAR` anchor + a `MARK_IMAGE` JSON snapshot — the exact
  bridge encoding from the Loro-extension work — so the image is a discrete,
  deletable inline that round-trips. (`MutationError::Encode` added.)
- **Editor**: `editor_insert::image_inline_from_bytes` detects the format from
  bytes (PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP/BMP), embeds them as a base64 `data:` URI, and sizes
  the image from its intrinsic pixels (`cx_emu`/`cy_emu` at 96 DPI so layout
  gives it a box). `insert_image_at_cursor` places it at the cursor focus.
- **UI**: the Image button spawns the platform file picker
  (`pick_file_to_open` → `token.open_read()`), builds the inline, inserts, and
  reports via the status banner (success / unsupported-format / no-cursor /
  error). `LUCIDE_IMAGE` icon added; `image` + `base64` deps added to `loki-text`.

Tests: `editor_insert` unit tests (data-URI + intrinsic size, non-image
rejected, discrete-image insertion, no-cursor no-op) and
`loro_mutation::insert_inline_image` (round-trips, rejects non-image).

Refactor folded in (ceiling): the self-contained **Save as Template** callback
moved to `editor_save_callbacks`, keeping `editor_inner` under 878 (now 855).

### 5d. Nested-addressing mutation extension — foundation shipped

The mutation layer can now address content **inside table cells**, not just
top-level section blocks. New `loro_mutation::nested`:

- **`BlockPath`** (`root` global block index + `CellStep` descents) names a
  block either at the top level or nested inside a table cell (recursively, in
  the bridge's flat head → bodies → foot cell order). `BlockPath::block(i)`
  resolves exactly like the flat API; `BlockPath::in_cell(root, cell, block)`
  reaches a cell's paragraph.
- Path-based text primitives `insert_text_at` / `delete_text_at` /
  `mark_text_at` / `get_block_text_at` / `get_mark_at_path` resolve the target
  `LoroText` through `KEY_TABLE_CELLS` and mutate it. Because the bridge rebuilds
  each cell from those same live containers, edits **round-trip** through
  `loro_to_document`. (`MutationError::InvalidBlockPath` added.)
- Tests (`loro_mutation_nested_tests`, 7 cases): read/insert/delete/mark inside
  a cell with round-trip, flat-path parity, and the two invalid-path errors
  (descend into a non-table block; out-of-range cell).

**Honest scope — what this does and does not unblock:**

- ✅ **Table cell text** is now reachable and editable at the CRDT layer (cells
  were already live containers from the table native mapping).
- ✅ **Footnote/endnote bodies** — now addressable too (see §5e + §5f): the
  `BlockPath` `PathStep::Note` descent reaches a note body's blocks, recursively
  (a note inside a table cell is `[Cell, Note]`).
- This is the *mutation-layer* foundation only. Driving it from the UI still
  needs (a) layout to assign positions to cell paragraphs, (b) hit-test/cursor
  to produce a nested position, and (c) `CursorState` to carry a `BlockPath`.
  And the **Table Insert control** additionally needs a block-insert primitive
  (insert a new `Block::Table` into a section).

### 5e. Footnote/endnote body — live container (bridge) shipped

Note bodies were previously a `serde`-JSON snapshot inside the `MARK_NOTE` mark
(rendered but inert). They are now **live CRDT containers**, mirroring table
cells:

- The anchor's `MARK_NOTE` mark now carries a `(NoteKind, idx)` pair; the body
  lives as a movable list of blocks under the block's new `KEY_NOTES` container
  at `idx` (written via the shared block path, so nested formatting/objects
  compose). Read back by walking `KEY_NOTES` (`loro_bridge::inline_objects` +
  `inlines_read`).
- The `idx` also **fixes a latent merge bug**: two adjacent footnotes used to
  share an identical mark and collapse into one rich-text delta span; the
  distinct `idx` keeps their anchors separate.
- Footnote text is therefore editable/mergeable CRDT state, not a blob — the
  representation half of "editable footnotes".

Tests: `loro_bridge_note_tests` (4 cases) — body is a live container (not a
blob), two adjacent footnotes keep distinct bodies, mixed footnote/endnote
kind+order, and no notes container when there are no notes — plus the existing
note round-trip tests still green. Refactor (ceiling): the inline-object write
helpers moved to `loro_bridge::inline_objects`, keeping `inlines.rs` ≤ 300.

### 5f. `BlockPath` note-descent — nested addressing complete

`BlockPath` now addresses **both** container kinds uniformly. `CellStep` was
generalised into a `PathStep` enum (`Cell { cell, block }` | `Note { note,
block }`); `descend` resolves either through `KEY_TABLE_CELLS` or `KEY_NOTES`.
New constructor `BlockPath::in_note(root, note, block)`, and arbitrary `steps`
support recursion — a footnote nested inside a table cell is `[Cell, Note]`.

Tests (`loro_mutation_nested_tests`, now 12): the table-cell cases plus
read/edit/round-trip inside a note body, addressing the correct note among
several, the no-notes-container error, and **editing a note nested inside a
table cell**. The path-based text/mark/get primitives are unchanged — they
resolve through the generalised `descend`.

The **mutation-layer nested-addressing story is now complete**: table cell text
and footnote/endnote bodies are uniformly reachable, editable, and round-tripping.

**Next increments (UI wiring):** cursor/hit-test must produce a nested position
and `CursorState` must carry a `BlockPath`, and layout must assign positions to
cell / note paragraphs — then the Table/Footnote Insert controls (Table also
needs a block-insert primitive) can offer in-place editing.

### 5g. Nested-editing UI wiring — architecture + staged plan

Investigation of the editing pipeline (this is a large vertical; staging it to
avoid risky half-built changes to the 1953-line `flow.rs`):

**How editing addressing works today (all flat):** layout emits one
`PageParagraphData { block_index, path, layout, origin }` per laid-out paragraph
into `PageEditingData`; `hit_test` maps a click to that paragraph and returns a
`DocumentPosition { page_index, paragraph_index = block_index, byte_offset }`;
the editor mutates `paragraph_index` as a flat global block index.

**Two findings that shape the work:**
- **Table cells are laid out in a throwaway `temp_state`** (`flow::measure_cell_height`)
  used only to measure height — cell paragraphs never reach the main flow's
  editable `current_paragraphs`. Emitting their editing data (with a `[Cell]`
  path and page-relative origins) is the substantive part.
- **Footnote bodies *do* flow into `current_paragraphs`, but with `block_index =
  0`** (`flow_footnotes` passes `0`). That is a *latent hit-test bug*: clicking a
  footnote body today targets block 0. Giving them the correct root + `[Note]`
  path fixes it.

**Staged plan:**
1. **Producer seam (this increment):** `PageParagraphData.path: Vec<PathStep>`
   (empty for top-level). All existing emitters set it empty via a new
   `push_editing_para` helper. No behaviour change.
2. ✅ **Position seam (shipped):** `DocumentPosition` gains `path: Vec<PathStep>`
   (empty = flat) + a `top_level(..)` constructor and `block_path()`; `hit_test`
   carries `para_data.path`; `CursorState::block_path()` yields a `BlockPath`.
   All ~15 production + test construction sites migrated; same-paragraph
   navigation preserves the path, cross-paragraph (top-level) clears it
   (`TODO(nested-nav)` for in-container sibling navigation). Unit tests cover
   flat vs. nested `block_path()`. Top-level editing unchanged.
3. **Layout emission:** emit `PageParagraphData` for table-cell paragraphs (real
   flow, page-relative origins, `[Cell]` path) and fix footnote bodies to carry
   `[Note]` + the owning block index.
   - ✅ **Footnote bodies (shipped):** `CollectedNote` now records its
     `owner_block_index` + `note_in_block` (set in `flow_paragraph`); a
     `FlowState.nested_editing` context (in the new `flow_editing` module, with
     `push_editing_para`) makes `flow_footnotes` tag each body paragraph with the
     owner block + a `PathStep::Note`. This **fixes the latent `block_index = 0`
     bug**. Test: `footnote_editing_tests`. *(Multi-paragraph note bodies are
     addressed per body block; a note body containing a table is a known edge —
     the inner cell paragraphs inherit the note context.)*
   - ✅ **Table cells (shipped):** the non-rotated cell path already flows cell
     blocks into the *main* state (only the block index/path were wrong), so a
     per-cell `NestedEditing::cell` context (keyed by a `cell_flat` counter that
     walks rows in the bridge's `head → bodies → foot` order) now tags each cell
     paragraph with the table's block + a `PathStep::Cell`. Test:
     `table_cell_editing_tests`. **Known limits:** rotated cells (laid out via
     `flow_cell_blocks`/`temp_state`) don't yet emit editing data (see
     increment 5); and a table nested in a cell/note doesn't yet compose paths.
     *(The vertically-aligned cell caret-y offset is fixed in increment 5.)*

   Increment 3 is **complete** for the common cases — clicks into top-aligned
   table cells and footnote bodies resolve to the correct `BlockPath`.
4. ✅ **Routing (shipped):** the editor's text mutations now build a `BlockPath`
   from the cursor and call the `*_at` primitives — identical for a top-level
   cursor, reaching the right container when nested. `resolve_format_range`
   returns a `BlockPath`; the formatting toggles, hyperlink, image-insert
   (new `insert_inline_image_at`, with the flat version delegating to it),
   typing (`insert_text_at`), and within-paragraph delete (`delete_text_at`)
   all route through it. Tests (`editor_insert_tests`): a nested cursor links
   and inserts an image *into a table cell*. Top-level editing unchanged.
   - ✅ **Path-aware split/merge (shipped):** `split_block_at` / `merge_block_at`
     resolve the *leaf step's* block list (a cell's or note body's movable list)
     via a new `resolve_block_list` seam and split/merge **within that
     container** — top-level `split_block`/`merge_block` now delegate to the same
     `*_in_list` cores (31 existing top-level tests unchanged). Enter and
     backspace-at-start route through the `*_at` variants for any cursor; the
     caret moves to the sibling block via `DocumentPosition::sibling_block`
     (which shifts the leaf `PathStep` block for a nested cursor, the
     `paragraph_index` for a top-level one). `merge_block_at` returns
     `NoPreviousBlock` at the first block of a container, so backspace there is a
     no-op (no container boundary is ever crossed). Tests
     (`loro_mutation_nested_tests`): split/merge inside a cell and a note body
     round-trip; merge at a cell's first block errors.
5. **Caret rendering** refinements for nested paragraphs.
   - ✅ **V-align caret-y (shipped):** a vertically-aligned (`Middle`/`Bottom`)
     cell translates its glyph items down by the alignment offset, but the
     editing-paragraph origins were left at the cell top, so the caret floated
     above the text. The non-rotated cell path now translates
     `current_paragraphs[cell_para_start..]` by the same `y_offset` as the
     items (`cell_para_start` captured before the cell's blocks flow), so the
     caret tracks the glyphs. Test (`table_cell_editing_tests`): the cell-0
     editing origin.y for `Bottom > Middle > Top` (all equal before the fix).
   - **Rotated-cell editing (deferred):** rotated cells lay content out in a
     width/height-swapped space wrapped in a `RotatedGroup`, and `flow_cell_blocks`
     discards its editing paragraphs. Emitting usable editing data needs the caret
     and hit-test to apply the same rotation transform — a dedicated task
     (`TODO(rotated-cell-editing)` in `flow.rs`). Rotated cells stay read-only
     for now (graceful: no caret rather than a wrong one).

   Then the **Table/Footnote Insert controls** (Table also needs a block-insert
   primitive).

Increment 1 shipped: `PageParagraphData.path` + the `push_editing_para` helper
(which also DRY-collapsed the six placement sites, keeping `flow_para.rs` under
its baselined ceiling). Increment 2 shipped: the `DocumentPosition`/`CursorState`
position seam (above). Both keep top-level editing unchanged; the **next
keystone is increment 3 — layout emission** for table-cell and note-body
paragraphs (the substantive `flow.rs`/`flow_table` work).

| **Measure the ribbon's own width** | ✅ `onmounted` → `MountedData::get_client_rect().await` works on any mounted element (the dioxus-native patch, `patches/dioxus-native-dom/src/mounted.rs`). The collapse engine measures the content row directly, or uses `use_viewport().inner_width_px` as a proxy. |
| **Width-driven (px, not class)** | ✅ `use_viewport()` exposes `inner_width_px: f32` (D3 needs px; `use_breakpoint()`'s class alone is insufficient). |
| **Overflow "more" menu** | ✅ `position: absolute` in a `position: relative` ancestor + `z-index` (the spell panel `editor_spell_panel.rs` is the production precedent). **No** `position: fixed` (collapses to absolute), **no** `box-shadow`, **no** custom properties — elevation via border/background. |
| **Hysteresis** | ✅ mirror `responsive::page_fit::resolve_page_fit` (`PAGE_FIT_HYSTERESIS_PX = 48`): keep the current collapse state until width crosses `threshold ± band`, so resizing across a boundary can't thrash. A `RIBBON_COLLAPSE_HYSTERESIS_PX` token follows the same shape. |

## 7. Corrections & confirmations vs. the spec's seeds

- **Footnotes** seeded "renders to an extent" → audit finds **complete render** → **Create-ready** (not render-only). (RB-7)
- **Math** "renders; create likely needs a surface" → **confirmed Render-only**; the create gap is real. (RB-8)
- **Shapes** "render status unknown" → **confirmed Unsupported** (zero shape-geometry render code). (RB-9)
- **"Existing bottom-ribbon-for-touch placement"** → **does not exist**; only safe-area-inset (`app.rs`) + Compact-detection infrastructure. M6 says "where applicable", so it's an optional build, and the collapse cascade may make it unnecessary on phones. (RB-11)
- **Framework** "half-built" → contextual + labeled-group + labeled-button capabilities **already exist**; the missing piece is specifically the **collapse cascade** and a **selection signal** for contextual tabs. (RB-1/RB-2/RB-5)

## 8. Milestone readiness

| Milestone | Prereqs present? | First step / blocker |
|---|---|---|
| **M1 — Framework + rename** | ✅ **Implemented** | `ribbon-tab-home`→`ribbon-tab-write` ("Write"); `home_tab_content`→`write_tab_content`; the Home *screen* key is untouched (collision resolved, RB-6). The framework (tab strip, labeled-group container, contextual mechanism, scroll overflow) already renders sanely at Expanded-by-default. |
| **M2 — Labeled groups everywhere** | ✅ **Implemented** | All five Write-tab groups now pass `label: Some(fl!("ribbon-group-…"))` (Document/History/Styles/Paragraph/Inline) — the icon-only `label: None` style is retired; the Write tab now matches Publish's labeled-section standard. Compact toggles (B/I/U) keep icon buttons under labeled sections (the Word convention). |
| **M3 — Collapse cascade** | ⚠️ needs new engine | Build the width-driven engine: per-group priority + condensed/overflow reps + overflow menu (`position: absolute`) + hysteresis (mirror `page_fit`). **The substantive build.** R-13e select-width handled in *condensed*. |
| **M4 — Render-gate + Insert tab** | ✅ capability table (§4) + create paths (§5) | Add the **Insert** tab with controls for the 5 Create-ready objects only; commit the §4 table. No math/shape controls. |
| **M5 — Remaining tabs + contextual** | ⚠️ needs selection signal (RB-5) | Add Layout/References/Review from existing features; add a `selected_object: Signal<Option<…>>` in `EditorState`, set it from pointer hit-tests, drive Table/Picture contextual tabs via `is_contextual`. |
| **M6 — Touch posture** | ✅ `TOUCH_MIN`, breakpoint | Bump tab strip to `TOUCH_MIN` at Compact (R-14); condensed select sizing (R-13e); bottom-ribbon placement *optional* (RB-11). |

## 9. Finding register

| ID | Severity | Finding | Anchor |
|---|---|---|---|
| RB-1 | Info | Framework already supports contextual tabs + labeled groups/buttons — D1/D2/contextual are mostly *content* work | §2, §7 |
| RB-2 | High | No width-driven collapse cascade (only a collapse toggle + `overflow-x: auto`) — the M3 build | §2 |
| RB-3 | Info | R-13e confirmed: `AtRibbonSelect` hardcodes `width: 180px` (`select.rs:73`) — condensed state must size it | §2 |
| RB-4 | Info | R-14 confirmed: tab strip `36px` (`RIBBON_TAB_STRIP_HEIGHT`) < 44 px touch min | §2 |
| RB-5 | Med | No selection-state signal exists; contextual Table/Picture tabs need a new `EditorState` signal fed by hit-tests | §2, §8 |
| RB-6 | ~~Info~~ **Resolved (M1)** | Two-Homes collision fixed: ribbon tab renamed `ribbon-tab-write = Write`; the `Home()` screen keeps its name. | §3 |
| RB-7 | Info | **Footnotes upgraded** to Create-ready (complete render, simple create) — not render-only | §4 |
| RB-8 | Info | Math is **Render-only** (renders partial; no create path) — equation editor = future spec | §4 |
| RB-9 | Info | Shapes are **Unsupported** (no shape-geometry render) — future renderer spec | §4 |
| RB-10 | Info | Blitz surface sufficient: self-width via `get_client_rect`, px via `use_viewport`, overflow via `position: absolute`, hysteresis via `page_fit` pattern | §6 |
| RB-11 | Info | **Spec correction:** "existing bottom-ribbon-for-touch placement" does not exist (only infrastructure); M6 optional | §7 |
| RB-12 | Info | Publish tab is the visual-standard *source*; audit confirms it stays its own tab (export is a distinct concern) | §3 |

## 10. Open questions for maintainer triage

1. **Sequencing.** M1/M2/M4 are low-risk content; M3 (collapse engine) is the real build and M5 needs a new selection signal. Land M1+M2 (rename + labeled standard) first, then M4 (Insert from the table), then M3 (collapse), then M5/M6 — or build the framework collapse engine before the content?
2. **Write tab group set.** Confirm the §9 Write grouping (Clipboard / Font / Paragraph / Styles / Editing) — the inventory has no Clipboard (cut/copy/paste) or Find/Replace controls yet. Map only existing controls (per "don't invent"), or is adding cut/copy/paste + find/replace in scope here?
3. **Header/Footer create surface (M4).** The 4 other Create-ready objects are cheap; headers/footers need a small block-editor surface. In scope for M4, or defer the header/footer Insert control while shipping the other four?
4. **Math & shapes.** Confirm math (Render-only) and shapes (Unsupported) get **no** Insert control and become their own future specs (equation editor; shape renderer) — as the capability table dictates.
5. **Collapse hysteresis + priority.** Reuse `PAGE_FIT_HYSTERESIS_PX = 48` (or a dedicated `RIBBON_COLLAPSE_HYSTERESIS_PX`)? And where do per-group collapse priorities get declared — on `AtRibbonGroup` as a new prop?
6. **Bottom-ribbon-for-touch (RB-11).** Build it now (it doesn't exist), or rely on the collapse cascade at Compact and defer bottom placement?

No code has been changed. Awaiting triage before implementing M1.
