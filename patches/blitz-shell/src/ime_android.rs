//! PATCH(loki): Android soft-keyboard visibility bridge.
//!
//! On a `NativeActivity` the OS never tells the app when the *user* dismisses
//! (or re-summons) the soft keyboard — the back button, the swipe-down gesture,
//! and the keyboard's own hide key are all invisible to winit / Blitz / Dioxus,
//! and the surface is not resized. Without a signal the app keeps the bottom
//! safe area reserved for a keyboard that is gone (dead space below the
//! document), and the `WindowState::ime_active` mirror goes stale so the next
//! caret tap needlessly takes the `force_show` re-summon path.
//!
//! `loki-file-access` installs a decor-view `OnApplyWindowInsetsListener` that
//! fires on every IME transition and calls [`notify_ime_visibility_changed`].
//! That callback arrives on the Android UI thread; this module hops it onto the
//! winit event loop by storing the new visibility and waking the loop with a
//! `Poll`. [`take_pending`] is then drained in `WindowState::poll`, which syncs
//! `ime_active` and arms the existing IME-settle re-sync so the bottom safe
//! area converges to the new keyboard height (0 on a collapse).
